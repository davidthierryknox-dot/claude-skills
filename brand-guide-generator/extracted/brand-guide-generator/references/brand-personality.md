2. "What 3 brands (any industry) do you admire and why?"
3. "What's one word you never want customers to use to describe you?"
4. "Is your brand more like a trusted advisor or an exciting friend?"
5. "When customers interact with you, should they feel: reassured, inspired, delighted, or empowered?"
